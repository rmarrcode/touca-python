Touca helps engineering teams understand the true impact of their code changes
on the behavior and performance of their software. Test your most complex
software workflows with any number of real-world inputs to significantly
reduce the risks of changing code in mission-critical systems.

üßë‚Äçüîß Install
=============

Touca SDK for Python can be installed via `pip <https://pypi.org/project/touca>`__:

.. code:: bash

    pip install touca

We formally support Python v3.6 and newer on Windows, Linux and macOS platforms.

‚ú® Features
===========

Touca is an automated regression testing system for testing complex
mission-critical workflows with any number of real-world inputs.

-  **Say Goodbye to Snapshot Files**

   Touca offers client libraries that help you capture test results or
   performance benchmarks from anywhere within your workflow and submit
   them to a remote Touca server where they are stored and compared
   against your baseline.

-  **Capture without Compromise**

   Unlike snapshot files that often store the output of a given version
   of your workflows, Touca gives you fine-grained control over what
   variables and return values to capture as test result.

-  **Lossless Comparison**

   Touca client libraries preserve the types of your captured data.
   The Touca server compares test results of any two versions of your
   workflow in their original data type.

-  **Scale without Worry**

   Managing result files for hundreds of test cases is not feasible at
   scale. Let the Touca server manage your test results, compare them
   against previous versions, and report any found differences in an
   easy to understand format.

üìñ Documentation
================

-  If you are new to Touca, the best place to start is our `Quickstart Guide <https://docs.touca.io/getting-started/quickstart>`__ on our documentation website.
-  For information on how to use this library, examples, and tutorials, checkout our `Python SDK Documentation <https://docs.touca.io/api/python-sdk>`__.
-  If you cannot wait to start writing your first test with Touca, checkout our `Python API Reference <https://app.touca.io/docs/clients/python/api.html>`__.

üöÄ Getting Started
==================

    This section is a condensed version of the Quick Start Guide on our
    documentation website, meant to give you a general idea of how Touca
    works. For more information and examples in other programming languages,
    check out our documentation website at docs.touca.io.

Let us imagine that we want to test a simple Code Under Test such as a function
that checks if a given number is prime or not.

.. code:: python

    def is_prime(number: int):
        pass

If we want to use unit testing, we'd write a test that invokes this function
with a number, and checks whether the actual return value of the function
matches our expected value. Here's a sample unit test.

.. code:: python

    from code_under_test import is_prime

    def test_is_prime():
        assert is_prime(-1) == False
        assert is_prime(1)  == False
        assert is_prime(2)  == True
        assert is_prime(13) == True

In the example above, the input and output of the Code Under Test were a
number and a boolean, respectively. If we were testing a video compression
algorithm, they may have been video files. In that case:

-  Describing the expected output for a given video file would be difficult.
-  When we make changes to our compression algorithm, accurately reflecting those changes in our expected values would be time-consuming.
-  We would need a large number of input video files to gain confidence that our algorithm works correctly.

We've built Touca to make it easier for software engineering teams to
continuously test their complex workflows with any number of
real-world inputs.

    Touca is a regression testing system; not a unit testing library.
    It tries to complement unit testing, not to replace it.

Touca takes a very different approach than unit testing.
Here's how the above test would look like:

.. code:: python

    import touca
    from code_under_test import is_prime

    @touca.Workflow
    def test_is_prime(testcase: str):
        touca.add_result("is_prime", is_prime(int(testcase)))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        touca.run()

Yes, we agree. This code needs some explanation. Let us start by reviewing
what is missing:

-  We have fully decoupled our test inputs from our test logic. Touca refers to these inputs as "test cases". The SDK retrieves the test cases from a file or a remote Touca server and feeds them one by one to our code under test.
-  We have completely removed the concept of "expected values". Instead, we are capturing the actual return value of ``is_prime`` via ``add_result``. We can capture any number of values, from anywhere within our code under test. These captured values are associated with their corresponding input value (test case) and are submitted to a remote Touca server, as we run the code under test for each input.

You may wonder how we verify the correctness of our code under test without
using expected values. Let us clarify: we don't. Since Touca is a regression
testing system, its objective is to help us verify if our code under test works
as before. The remote server compares the submitted "actual values" against
those submitted for a previous "baseline" version of our code, and reports
differences. As long as we trust the "baseline" version of our
software, knowing that such comparison does not reveal any differences, can
help us conclude that our new version works as well as before.

Once we build this code as a separate executable, we can run it as shown
below.

.. code:: bash

    export TOUCA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
    python3 test_prime_app.py --api-url https://api.touca.io/@/acme/prime_app/v2.0

Notice that we are including the version of our code as part of the URL to
our remote Touca server. Touca SDKs are very flexible in how we pass this
information. The above command produces the following output:

.. code::

    Touca Regression Test Framework
    Suite: prime_app
    Revision: v2.0

     (  1 of 4  ) 1                          (pass, 127 ms)
     (  2 of 4  ) 2                          (pass, 123 ms)
     (  3 of 4  ) 13                         (pass, 159 ms)
     (  4 of 4  ) 71                         (pass, 140 ms)

    processed 4 of 4 test cases
    test completed in 565 ms

If and when we change the implementation of ``is_prime``, we can rerun the
test and submit the new results for the new version to the Touca server.
The server takes care of storing and comparing the results submitted between
the two versions and reports the differences in near real-time.

This approach is effective in addressing common problems in the following
situations:

-  When we need to test our workflow with a large number of inputs.
-  When the output of our workflow is too complex, or too difficult to describe in our unit tests.
-  When interesting information to check for regression is not exposed by the workflow's interface.

The fundamental design features of Touca that we highlighted earlier
can help us test these workflows at any scale.

-  Decoupling our test input from our test logic, can help us manage our long list of inputs without modifying the test logic. Managing that list on a remote server accessible to all members of our team, can help us add notes to each test case, explain why they are needed and track how their performance changes over time.
-  Submitting our test results to a remote server, instead of storing them in files, can help us avoid the mundane tasks of managing and processing of those results. The Touca server retains test results and makes them accessible to all members of the team. It compares test results using their original data types and reports discovered differences in real-time to all interested members of our team. It allows us to audit how our software evolves over time and provides high-level information about our tests.
